"From December 27, 2024, to February 10, 2025, I solved a wide range of algorithm problems on Baekjoon Online Judge using C programming. 
Baekjoon is a platform that requires not only solving problems but also designing efficient algorithms and optimizing time complexity, which allowed me to showcase my problem-solving strategies, optimization techniques, and memory management skills in C. 
The low-level nature of C allowed me to gain deep expertise in areas like memory allocation, pointer manipulation, and handling structures and arrays, which helped me develop a unique set of problem-solving skills.
As I solved various problems, I learned the value of code optimization and debugging, as well as the persistence and determination required to solve problems to completion. 
In particular, solving problems with time constraints helped me understand the importance of efficiency and performance optimization. 
Through this experience, I not only improved my implementation skills but also developed the ability to solve more complex system problems that may be encountered in the workplace, significantly enhancing my overall problem-solving capabilities."
